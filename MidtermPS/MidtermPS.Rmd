## Part c {.tabset}

If we compare the histograms, looking at the quantiles and means for both service models, the service model where the time for each of the service tasks within a service process is a *uniform*(0.1, 0.2) random variate, is a little faster since it's service times are lower. 

### *Uniform*(0.1,0.2)

```{r}

uniform0.2 = scan("C:/Users/smangane/OneDrive - bates.edu/DCS307/Coding Files/.Rproj.user/uniform0.2st.txt")
hist(uniform0.2, breaks = 50, main = "Histogram of service model Uniform(0.1, 0.2)")
m.2 <- mean(uniform0.2)
abline(v = m.2, col = "blue")
c.2 <- quantile(uniform0.2)
abline(v = c.2, col = "red", lty = 5)

```

Mean: `r m.2`
Quantiles: `r c.2`


### *Uniform*(0.1,0.3)

```{r}

uniform0.3 = scan("C:/Users/smangane/OneDrive - bates.edu/DCS307/Coding Files/.Rproj.user/uniform0.3st.txt")
hist(uniform0.3, breaks = 50, main = "Histogram of service model Uniform(0.1, 0.3)")
m.3 <- mean(uniform0.3)
abline(v = m.3, col = "blue")
c.3 <- quantile(uniform0.3)
abline(v = c.3, col = "red", lty = 5)

```

Mean: `r m.3`
Quantiles: `r c.3`

## {-}

## Part d

As a result of the slower service rates, the probability of rejection is higher, since it takes longer to serve people and people stay in the system longer. This is also why the average sojourn time for the second service model (*uniform*(0.1,0.3)) is also higher. 

## Part e

At first, I was getting negative numbers for my numbers in the system and the average sojourn time, which didn't logically make sense, which is how I knew the code was wrong. However, once I started getting positives, I knew that the probability of rejection should decrease as the capacity increases, since more people would be allowed in the system. Moreover, the average sojourn time should increase as the capacity increases, because less people are getting rejected, meaning more people in the queue waiting to be served and being in the system longer. Additionally, the average number in the system is about 1 number higher than the average queue in the system (which makes sense because the number of jobs in the queue is equal to the number of jobs in the system - 1), and the utilization is just below 1. As the capacity increased, I saw these patterns for my simulations, which helped me realize that my numbers were correct.

# Problem 3

## Part a
 
```{r montecarlo 1}

scores <- c()
counts <- c()

for(i in 1:1000){
  testquestions <- c()
  #create a test, 12 #'s picked randomly and w/o replacement from a list of 120
  testquestions <- append(testquestions, sample(1:120,12, replace = FALSE)) #returns a list of 12 random #'s
  
  #generating an answer for each question on the test
  answers <- c()
  for(i in 1:12){
    if(testquestions[i] <= 90){ #first 90 is class I questions 
      probs = c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2)
      answers <- append(answers, sample(probs,1, replace = FALSE))
   } else{
      probs = c(3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)
      answers <- append(answers, sample(probs,1, replace = FALSE))
    }
  } 
  
  #getting score for this test  
  score <- sum(answers)
  
  #add to list of scores
  scores <- append(scores, score)
}


hist(as.numeric(scores), main = "Histogram when N = 1000", xlab = "Estimated Scores from 1000 Tests")


```

## Part b

```{r montecarlo 2}
#probability that you pass the test, loops thru each value in scores
  for(score in scores){
    if(score >= 36){ 
      counts <- append(counts, 1)
   }else{
      counts <- append(counts, 0)
    }
  }

result = (sum(counts)/1000) * 100
```

 The probability of passing this test, based on this histogram is `r result`%


## Part c

```{r montecarlo 3}
t.test(scores)
```

Based on what's printed above, I'm 95% confident that the true score lies in between 35.62 and 36.08 and am unsure about the rest of the values. This makes sense based on the shape of our histogram (with the highest peak being around 35-36) and the probability that we get, `r result`%.
