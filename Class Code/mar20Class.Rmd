# Notes for Midterm

## Little's eyns equation:

avg. number in system (we have this) = $\frac{\textrm{max # of customers}}{\textrm{time at end}} * $ Average sojourn (this is what we want),

thus: avg. sojourn = $\frac{\textrm{time at end}}{\textrm{max # of customers}} * $ Average num in system, and

sum \# in system area = $\textrm{time at end} * \textrm{avg. # in system}$

Same logic applies to the average wait ($\textrm{time at end} * \textrm{avg. # in queue}$) and service time ($\textrm{time at end} * \textrm{avg. utilization}$)

```{r }
