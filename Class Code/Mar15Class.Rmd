"all models are wrong (not identical to the real world), only models are useful approximations" - George Box


# Notes: Agent Based Modeling Lab

open calendar.py, person.py (edit the method section, specfically, how they're going to move), room.py and then run 'python simulation.py' in the terminal

(Using Python, simulus)

- record when they arrive and immideatly scheule when they move (not at the entry way)
everytime someone moves, you schedule a arrival



```{python}
list = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 , 3]
max(list)
min(list)
```
