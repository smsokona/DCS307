In our code, the amount of customers and the rate at which they were arriving is constant, across all the graphs. Waht we've changed for each graph is the seed (which ensures that each simulation is different) and the service rate. In the first graph, despite the different simulations (seeds), when we have customers arriving at the same rate, the average wait time becomes the same and is converging (probably at 10000 jobs it will approach the theoritical sojourn time). When we change the service rate, in the second graph, we see the distribution of the average wait time looks a little different, also is converging. For the third graph we increase the shape (from 1 to 1.05), but the shape of the graph changes a bit and looks more like a gamma funciton (based on what I saw in probability). The wait time for all simulation also seems to be converging here. For the last graph, we also increassed the shape by the same unit (0.05), however, the wait time isn't converging here. I wonder why this graph looks drastically different from the others despite the similar service rate and the same seeds. It also seems like theres a jump discontinuity for the 3rd gamma process, however, this may be ecause my code is wrong! Nonetheless, it seems like if we we increase our k parameter (the shape), then the average sojourn time also increases, regardless of whether it converges or not (and we see this for gamma processes 2 and 3).
