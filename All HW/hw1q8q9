8. This experiment is closely related to what we did in probability. We can think of each estimate as an experiment and the number of rolls as the sample size. Because we only used 10 rolls (which is a very small sample size) for our histogram in the top left corner, we don't see a normal curve. As the number of rolls increase and thus the sample size, the histogram looks more normal and we get closer to a mean of 0.125, which is the probability (if you calculate it mathematically)! If we look at the quantiles for the histograms on the top row, the quantiles get smaller and 50% quantile approaches 0.125. Our data becomes less varried which is also why the standard variations becomes smaller and is closer to the mean as we increase the number of rolls. 

9. Here, we use the same sample size, however, we're changing the number of experiments we run. As a result, the standard deviation and mean don't change as much as it did for the for the first row. The bottom left histogram almost looks like a normal curve and then becomes more normal as we run more experiments, but the change isn't as drastic as the first row. Our frquencies change as a result (decrease for the first row but increase for the second row). If we look at the quantiles for the second row of histograms, the data is already tightly compact and becomes more compact as we increase the number of estimates.
